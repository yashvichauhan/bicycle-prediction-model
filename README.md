# Bicycle Theft Prediction

This project predicts whether a bicycle is likely to be stolen based on various factors such as the bike's location, usage, and other features. It utilizes machine learning algorithms for predictive analysis and classification.

## Overview

This project involves predicting the likelihood of a bicycle being stolen using machine learning. The dataset includes various features that influence the likelihood of theft, and we use classification algorithms to train a model that predicts whether a bicycle is likely to be stolen based on these features.

## Features

- **Location**: The geographic location where the bicycle is parked.
- **Time of Day**: The time the bicycle was last used or parked.
- **Bike Model, Make, Cost and Color**: Bike details such as model, make, total cost and color of it.
- **Security Features**: Information about locks or security measures on the bike.
- **Area and premises type**: Features like the the type of premises in which it has been parked and surrounding area.

## Key Technologies

- **Python**: The main programming language used for building the project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building the machine learning classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For writing and testing the code.
- **Flask**: For creating a simple web interface (if applicable).


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Toronto Police Service's open data portal. It includes historical bicycle theft data with details on incidents such as location, time, and other relevant factors.
